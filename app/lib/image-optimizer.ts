// This is a placeholder for a server-side image optimization pipeline.
// In production, use a service like imgproxy, Cloudflare Images, or S3 Lambda triggers.
// For Next.js, you can use the built-in Image Optimization API (next/image).

// If you want to proxy/optimize remote images, implement a custom API route here.
// Example: /api/image?src=...&w=...&q=...

// For now, use next/image for responsive, optimized delivery.
