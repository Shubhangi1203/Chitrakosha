# Design Document

## Overview

Chitrakosha is an artwork marketplace built with Next.js, Prisma, PostgreSQL, and shadcn/ui components. The platform enables artists to showcase and sell their artwork while providing art enthusiasts with a seamless browsing and purchasing experience. This document outlines the technical design and architecture decisions for implementing the complete marketplace.

## Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

The application follows Next.js App Router architecture with the following key components:

1. **Page Components**: React components that represent full pages in the application
2. **Layout Components**: Components that provide consistent structure across multiple pages
3. **UI Components**: Reusable shadcn/ui components for consistent design language
4. **Client Components**: Components marked with 'use client' for client-side interactivity
5. **Server Components**: Components that run on the server for improved performance and SEO

### Backend Architecture

The backend architecture consists of:

1. **API Routes**: Next.js API routes for handling data operations
2. **Database Layer**: Prisma ORM for type-safe database access
3. **Authentication**: NextAuth.js for user authentication and session management
4. **Storage**: Cloud storage for artwork images
5. **Payment Gateway**: Razorpay integration for payment processing
6. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for auction bidding

## Data Models

The data models are already well-defined in the Prisma schema. Key models include:

1. **User**: Core user information with authentication details
2. **Artwork**: Artwork details including price and status
3. **Auction**: Auction information linked to artwork
4. **Bid**: Individual bids on auctions
5. **Order**: Purchase orders for artworks
6. **Community**: Art communities
7. **Post**: User posts within communities
8. **Comment**: Comments on posts
9. **ArtistApplication**: Applications for artist status

## Error Handling

The application will implement a comprehensive error handling strategy:

1. **Frontend Error Handling**
   - Form validation with real-time feedback
   - Error boundaries for component-level errors
   - Toast notifications for user feedback
   - Loading states for asynchronous operations

2. **API Error Handling**

The application will be deployed on Vercel, which provides:
- Global CDN for static assets
- Serverless functions for API routes
- Preview deployments for testing
- Environment variable management

## Performance Optimization
